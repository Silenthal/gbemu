GBEmu is a WIP C# Gameboy emulator. Currently, not all common emulator
functions are emulated, and there are still some graphical errors.

Controls (subject to change):
A = X
B = Z
Start = Enter
Select = Shift
Up = Up Arrow
Down = Down Arrow
Left = Left Arrow
Right = Right Arrow
Pause/Resume = P

Controls are currently hardcoded in Win32InputHandler.
